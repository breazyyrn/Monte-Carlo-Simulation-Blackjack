 a Card, a Deck, a Hand, and Game(Blackjack).

Text-Based game

2 Players (The player & the house)

An Ace is worth 11 points

The player & the house should each receive two cards dealt from a deck

Each player calculate the sum of the two cards dealt to them

Choose either to hit or stand (Maybe if statement for this)

If the player chooses to hit, then if the new value of their hand is greater than 21, 
the player loses (buss) and the game is over. 
If the value is less than 21, the player repeats the process until they stand or bust.

If the player doesn't bust, the dealer plays
The dealer will continue to take a card(hit) until the value of their
hand is 17 or greater
If the dealer busts, then the player wins.

If player and dealer both avoided a bust, then the hand with the highest value wins the game. If both hands are of equal value
then the hand is a tie(push)

Deck is usually not rebuilt and shuffled
between each game isntead it's only rebuilt
once the amount of cards left in the list is
less than a certain number of cards
