# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-Blackjack
The main purpose of this project is to give you practice building classes in Java. To do this, we'll simulate a simple version of the card game Blackjack. The objects in a card game include: a Card, a Deck, a Hand, and Game. You'll make a class for each one, connecting them together as appropriate. We'll also start to make use of a few of the many Java library classes.
